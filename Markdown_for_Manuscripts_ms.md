Abstract
--------

Set up the problem. Explain how you solve it. Tell what you find. Explain why it's the best thing ever.


Introduction
------------

Background and problem setup [@Hocking2014a; @Hocking2014]

Relevant literature [@Hocking2013; @Hocking2013f]

Objectives/hypotheses


Methods
-------

Describe what you did so it can actually be repeated. I don't want to see everything in the supplementary materials. Here's an example of using LaTeX to add equations:

$$
T_s = \mu + \frac{\alpha - \mu}{1 + e^{\gamma(\beta - T_a)}}
$$


Results
-------

Explain what you found. Avoid blind *P-values* (or avoid *P-values* altogether)

Discussion
----------

Give context to what you found. Relate it to previous work. Describe why it's the most important scientific finding of the decade, yet avoid hyperbole. Easy, right?
